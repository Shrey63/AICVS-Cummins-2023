                   <p>
                    Hi guys! I am Ashlesha Ahirwadi, a final year B.Tech Information Technology student at
                    Cummins College Of Engineering for Women, Pune. I have done 2 research internships until
                    now - one at DRDO and one at the Symbiosis Centre For Medical Image Analysis in the domain
                    of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have written 2 research papers, one of which is
                    about the recent trend in engineering and technology which is accepted and under the
                    publishing phase at the 6th international conference. The other is under review at an
                    international conference. I’m here today to talk to you about research and the journey to get a
                    research internship.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                    Research is a bit different from the normal corporate environment. You need to review past
                    literature, be updated on latest developments and try to come up with a novel solution. For an
                    undergraduate student, it is somewhat difficult to get research experience because we lack
                    deep knowledge, skills and experience in the concerned subject. But there are ways you can
                    tackle the above issues and grab a research internship.
                    
                   </p>
                   <p>
                      
                      <b>How can I get a research internship?
                      </b>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    First and foremost, one would wonder what the prerequisites are to grab such an opportunity.
Although the eligibility criteria differs from organization to organization, what matters the most to
an organization is your interest in their particular domain and the commitment you bring to the
table.
 <br>
  Other than this, foundational knowledge about the subject should be enough for you to get
  started.
 
</p>
 
<p>
  Many organizations do not open forms or have a recruitment drive for research positions. The
  easiest and the most painstaking way to approach this, and also the way I approached it is ‘Cold
  emailing’.This is a powerful tool one can use to grab research internships.Cold emailing is a
  process through which we mail the considered person whose research topics / domain /
  methodologies you relate to the most.
   
    
</p>
<p>
  The cold mail you send should have details about: 
  <br>
  1. You and your educational qualifications such as college name, year, branch
  <br>
  2. Your interest and what you want to work on.
  <br>
  3. Duration of work
  <br>
    4. Documents- Resume, Marksheet, any certificates or research papers showing past
    experiences (if any)
</p>
<p> 
The concerned person may take forever to reply and many times you may not get a reply at all.
So send mails to as many people as possible and do not get disheartened if you do not get any
response from them. Connect with as many people - professors and seniors, as you can
through linkedin.
<br>
Once you get a positive reply, they will carry on with the further process. You might be called to
the organization for a discussion on your expectations from the internship and research topic.
Be relaxed as it is just a discussion and not an interview.
</p>
<p>
  <b> The Case for Research Internships:</b> 
</p>
<p>
  Research internships helped me explore different domains in the huge market of AI. It helped
me choose my way through for a specialization for my further studies.
Research shows you the intricate problems in the society of your domain, like biased datasets,
AI ethics and many more. You can then go ahead and explore these problems to come up with
a novel solution and make the world a better place.
<br>
<br>
Based on my experience, I can very well say that everyone should try to do at least one
research internship/project in their undergraduate as it helps you explore and decide your field
of interest at the crux of it.
Remember, just send those emails. Ignore the rejects and don't get disheartened by them
because believe me, it will all be worth it in the end.

                      Ever wondered how computers understand what you write? How do they categorize your tweets as
                      positive or negative, or predict the next word in your sentences(autofill)? Well, it's all thanks to the
                      magic of text classification, a crucial field in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
                      If you're a first-year student, you might be familiar with the traditional rule-based methods for text
                      classification. These rely on pre-defined rules and require deep domain knowledge, kind of like a
                      robot following a strict script. But here's the catch: these rules can't adapt to the
                      ever-changing world of language.
                      <br>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      That's where machine learning steps in, and things start getting really cool! Deep learning models
                      have taken text classification to a whole new level, surpassing those old-school methods in tasks
                      like sentiment analysis, news categorization, and even answering your most unusual questions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      My work in Natural Language Processing (NLP) exposed me to its incredible applications such as
                      Sentiment Analysis, language translation, text generation, and summarization. It all began when I
                      took a deep dive into the influential research paper "Attention is All You Need." This paper, a
                      cornerstone in the development of transformers, revealed the power of attention and its ability to
                      revolutionize how we process and understand information. My internship experience further
                      solidified my passion for this field. I was involved in building a sentiment analysis application, where
                      I witnessed the effectiveness of attention models in extracting nuanced sentiment from complex
                      textual data. Additionally, I contributed to data preparation for an application which was similar to
                      ChatGPT, deepening my knowledge of how attention mechanisms facilitate the generation of
                      human-quality text.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Here's a quick rundown of the different types of deep learning models for text classification:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      <b>1. Feed-Forward Networks:</b> Imagine a text as a jumbled bag of words. That's how these networks
                      see it. They analyze the individual words and their frequency, making predictions based on these
                      simple features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>2. RNN - The Word Sequencers:</b>  These models imagine text as a sequence of words, allowing
                      them to capture the relationships between them. Think of it like reading a sentence, where each
                      word depends on the one before it to make sense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>3. CNN - The Pattern Hunters:</b>  These models are like detectives, searching for patterns in text, like
                      key phrases or word combinations, to identify different categories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>4. Transformers - The Attention Masters:</b>These models use the powerful concept of "attention" to
                      understand which words are most important for a specific task. Imagine focusing on specific words
                      in a conversation, ignoring others – that's what attention does for text classification.
                      <p>
                      But wait, there's more! This field is constantly evolving, with new models like BERT and GPT-3
                      pushing the boundaries of AI’s possibilities. These models are trained on massive amounts of data,
                      allowing them to understand text with an almost human-like level of sophistication.
                    </p>
                      So, where does this leave us? Well, the future of text classification is bright, and it's driven by the
                      power of deep learning. As computer engineering students, we have the opportunity to be at the
                      forefront of this exciting field, building the next generation of models that understand and process
                      language in ways never imagined before.
                      Throughout this journey, three key lessons that have resonated deeply with me are: <br><br>
                      <b>● Embrace the power of attention:</b> Attention is not just a buzzword; it's a fundamental 
                      building block of modern AI. Understanding how attention works and how it can be applied 
                      to various tasks is crucial for any aspiring AI/ML practitioner. <br><br>
                      <b>● Dive deep into theory, practice, and personal projects:</b> A solid foundation in theoretical
                      concepts is essential for success in the field of AI/ML. However, theoretical knowledge
                      alone is insufficient. Complementing theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience will
                      give you an edge. Participating in courses, internships, and personal projects will allow you
                      to apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios and gain valuable insights. Go out of your
                      way to explore pre-trained models such as GPT-3 or applications such as text generation.
                      While doing this, also remember to take in consideration the ethical questions that AI raises.
                      Be mindful of potential biases and strive to develop and apply AI responsibly. <br><br>
                      <b>● Network and collaborate:</b> The world of AI/ML is vast and ever-evolving. Networking with
                      fellow enthusiasts and professionals can provide invaluable support, guidance, and
                      opportunities. Collaborating on projects allows you to learn from others and contribute to the
                      advancement of this exciting field.
                      <p>
                      Barring your technical knowledge, clear and concise communication is equally important. Honing
                      your ability to explain complex concepts in simple terms, effectively showcasing your project work,
                      and articulating your passion for generative AI to potential employers makes you stand out during
                      interviews and leaves a positive impression.
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                      This path is filled with exciting discoveries, challenging obstacles, and endless possibilities. Embrace
                      it with curiosity, determination, and a love for learning. Never stop learning and take your setbacks
                      as an opportunity to grow. And perhaps most importantly, have fun! Enjoy the process.

                  <b>Introduction</b>
                  <p>Hello! I am Meghana Bhange, a machine learning engineer currently pursuing my Master’s Degree in Information Technology Engineering at École de Technologie Supérieure, Montreal, with a research focus on privacy-preserving technologies at the Trustworthy Information Systems Lab. My journey in the tech world has been driven by my fascination with artificial intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Computer Security.</p>
                  
                  <p>There is no one-size-fits-all path to entering the world of ML, but a solid foundation in computer science and mathematics is beneficial. I benefited a lot from taking online courses from various sources like <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning</a> as well as hands-on experience. This helped build practical knowledge before my internships. I did my first internship at Verloop.io and, from my experience, I believe startups greatly help you to understand how to structure your code, what kind of metrics you would be optimizing for, and seeing your features go from inception to production, all during your internship. I later started my full-time role as a Machine Learning Engineer at Verloop. After a year I joined Hunters.security as an ML engineer and now I mostly work as a Machine Learning/NLP Freelancer via Toptal.</p>
                  
                  <b>Understanding the Interview Process</b>
                  <p>Each role and each company has a different process when it comes to hiring in Machine Learning but certain things are common in most of them. I would recommend going through Cracking <a href="https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> for the DSA questions of the interview and <a href="https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/">Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews from Chip Huyen</a> to understand ML interview processes.</p>
                  
                  <p>Overall, if I had to summarize the skills that would greatly help throughout your career, they would be:</p>
                  <ol>

                                Generation Google Scholarship.
                                Generation Google was the first achievement in my career and it paved way for me to get more
                                achievements by providing me the confidence to achieve more and more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Generation Google Scholarship, initially known as The Women Techmakers Scholars Program, embodies Dr. Anita Borg's vision of achieving gender equality in the tech industry. I stumbled upon this life-changing opportunity through LinkedIn, and it transformed my career. Selected among the top women in the Asia-Pacific region, the scholarship instilled confidence and pride in my abilities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, let's dive into the nitty-gritty of the application process. It's relatively straightforward, requiring applicants to provide personal information, a resume, and essay responses. These essays are pivotal; they serve as a canvas to display your leadership abilities, community involvement, tech interests, and contributions to underrepresented communities.
                                When it comes to crafting these essays, my advice is to keep them authentic, straightforward, and brimming with your passion for technology and community. Don't hesitate to include visual elements like images and videos to substantiate your claims. Seek feedback from past scholars to fine-tune your essays.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your resume should be a highlight reel of your technical skills, leadership roles, and community engagement. To tackle the coding test successfully, make sure your Data Structures and Algorithm skills are top-notch.
                                The final hurdle in the selection process is the interview, where you'll converse with a Googler. Confidence is your greatest asset here. Expect questions related to your resume and essays, but remember, it's an HR round, not a technical one. Tailor your responses based on your interviewer's expertise, whether it's outreach or technical matters. Quantify your achievements, emphasize your journey, and exude self-belief.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Becoming a Generation Google Scholar requires dedication right from your early academic years. Engage in projects and community activities to build a compelling application.
                                I'm proud to say that the advice I've shared has already helped many of my juniors secure this prestigious scholarship. My hope is that these insights inspire and empower you as you embark on your own journey towards becoming a Generation Google Scholar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In conclusion, my experience as a Generation Google Scholar has been nothing short of life-changing. It has not only opened doors but also given me the chance to contribute to the cause of gender equality in technology. Cheers to all the aspiring scholars out there! Your journey begins now

                                Just amidst the multitude of internship tales you might have encountered, let me share my journey into the heart of India's most esteemed organization. An institution teeming with brilliant minds akin to galaxies, planets, and stars. To us, they are celestial wonders, but for them, it's a canvas for exploring the cosmos. This extraordinary establishment rests in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and here's how I became a part of it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The How, When, and Why:
                                Initially, I followed the usual path of seeking internships through my college. Simultaneously, I decided to throw my hat into the ring for ISRO's off-campus student program. Uncertain of my chances, I kept my options open for other companies through my college. My friend Rutuja Deshpande and I submitted our applications for the ISRO program in March. After a seemingly endless silence, hope dwindled. Amid the chaos of the Suez Canal incident on campus, an email from ISRO arrived. Our applications had been accepted, and interviews were scheduled.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Excitement surged, but we were clueless about preparation. We scoured the internet for potential interview questions. When the day came, they asked:

                                <ul type="a" class="p1">
                                    <div class="div1">
                                      <li>Which projects have you completed?</li>
                                      <li>On which software have you worked?</li>
                                      <li>Why should we have you?</li>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="p2">
                                      <li>What qualities in you can bring a change in our organization?</li>
                                      <li>Which domains do you want to work for? And why?</li>
                                      <li>And many related to the projects and core basics.</li>
                                    </div>
                                </ul>
                            
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After another anxious wait, we received acceptance letters in mid-May, along with details about our mentors and department, Antenna Mechanical Design Division (AMDD). A week of training led to the assignment of our projects.
                                For anyone aspiring to join ISRO, it's a dream come true. It's like a child at a fair, gazing in awe at the towering Ferris wheel, trying to capture every marvel with eyes that can never see enough. The remarkable work and projects at ISRO left me spellbound. Experiencing these incredible feats up close was an absolute honor.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Speaking of my project, it was research-based and involved working with Ansys and NX software platforms. My knowledge of core subjects like Strength of Materials, Machine Design, Materials Technology, and Mechanism Analysis and Synthesis proved invaluable. Concepts like buckling, bending moments, and material properties played a pivotal role.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For those with ISRO aspirations, it's an unparalleled learning experience. The knowledge and expertise gained during the internship will undoubtedly benefit future endeavors, bolstering both your resume and personal growth.
                                I extend my heartfelt gratitude to ISRO's Space Applications Center for this incredible opportunity.

                                As a part of the AICVS Webinar 3.0, AICVS had the privilege of hosting Sanjana Date, a B.Tech student at Cummins College of Engineering for Women, who enlightened the audience on the captivating realm of "Bringing Realism in Mobile Augmented Reality."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sanjana commenced the session by providing a concise introduction to augmented reality (AR), elucidating the distinctions between AR, virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality. Augmented reality enriches your surroundings by seamlessly integrating digital elements into a live view, often utilizing the camera on a smartphone. In contrast, virtual reality immerses you entirely in a simulated environment, replacing real-life surroundings, while mixed reality amalgamates elements of both.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Delving deeper, she delved into various AR concepts, including occlusion, which empowers virtual AR objects to be obscured by physical objects in the real world, and Pose in 3D. Sanjana also shed light on technological advancements like Learning Optimized Local Difference Binaries, Space Sharing Using Markerless AR, and Google's AR Core.
                            <p>

                                In this session, she started with a brief about what AI is all about. Understanding its clear meaning and its domain is important. Further, she covered about Applications of AI and how it can be useful in the present as well as the future. Further, a brief idea was given on how Instagram uses its AI. Because of this, Instagram has more engagement of users than before. She further added Instagram uses Word Embeddings. It is a process where it tracks what a particular likes videos, saves them, or ignores them. Accordingly, AI will give recommendations on top of that videos or images, or reels next time whenever a user is active.

                                AICVS conducted a webinar on 16th October 2021 on <strong>‘Undergrad Research and Applying to PhD Programs’</strong> by Michelle Davis Thalakottur. Michelle is a recent graduate of computer engineering department in Cummins College of Engineering for Women and currently a Computer Science PhD student at Northeastern University where she works on research problems in web assembly. As an undergraduate, she has pursued research internships at IIT Bombay (on compiler generation and data flow analysis) and at IIT Patna (on Dimensionality Reduction and Metric Learning).She has even worked on her BTech project at IIT Bombay on the topic of Formalization of Translation performed by SCLP Complier phases.

                            <p>
                               <h5>What is Research?</h5>
                        
                                This is a very hard question which can take hours to answer. Michelle recommends some talks to look at (What is research by Uday Khedkar and You and your research by Richard Hamming) to gain more insight. Michelle says for her, research is about learning and original thinking, and pushing the boundaries of human innovation at its purest.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             <h5>Why you should consider Research?</h5>
                        
                                It is very useful in campus placements. The ability to do research shows that you have an ability to learn new concepts deeply, apply them and present it. This is something that you could definitely talk about in an interview and people would be excited to hear it. However, it won’t ensure you a job as a Software Engineer. Research and Software Engineering are both different fields.
                                On the other side, if you want to pursue further studies like Masters or PhD program, then these admission committees value research experience. PhD programs value it a lot more than Masters programs and the more competitive the program is, the more they value the experience generally. Michelle recommends looking at other student profiles to gain more insight on the admission processes and the related student’s research experience.

                                <h5>Can I do an independent research where I don’t have a professor advising me?</h5>
                        
                                Though you can pursue an independent undergrad research but there is a lot to gain when you have a professor to guide you. Good professors are worth their weight in gold. Do chase opportunities to learn from these fantastic people. It is a great way to try out research and see if it fits you or not!

                               <h5>How do you ‘do’ a research internship?</h5>
                                <h6>Part A:</h6> Before applying:
                                <br>
                                Pick a domain that you're interested in and dive right in.
                                <br>
                                Explore anything and everything that seems interesting to you.
                                <br>
                                Try out different websites, books, courses to find out your interest.
                                <br>
                                Build projects.
                                <br>
                                As an undergrad, it is a great time for you to try stuff out.
                                <br>
                                <h6>Part B:</h6>
                                 Applying:
                                 <br>
                                 Here, learning outcomes matter much more than your CGPA.
                                 <br>
                                 Michelle suggests talking to your professors about the research and domains you are interested in.
                                 <br>
                                 Try to build up a personal relationship with these professors.
                                 <br>
                                 Also, ask them about any active research going on in your interested domain and if they can refer you to the researcher.
                                 <br>
                                 This is the recommended approach by Michelle. Another approach is sending cold email.
                                 <br>
                                 If you want to cold email a professor, do not just email them your CV and CGPA.Rather than that, visit their website and read their research papers.
                                 <br>
                                 You can email them your questions or a specific problem that you would like to work on. That way, it is much easier for professors to respond to your mail.
                                 <br>
                                 Then, ask them about research internships. Be prepared to send a lot of emails! Be prepared to get rejected a lot! Another approach is to apply for research programs.
                                <br>
                                <h6>Part C:</h6>
                                 After applying:
                                 <br>
                                 If you get in early, ask them if you can start working as soon as possible.
                                 <br>
                                  Do believe in yourself.
                                  <br>
                                 Fight for good work if it’s necessary.
                                 <br>
                                 Focus on your work.
                                 <br>
                                  If quality of your work is good, you might get an opportunity to publish a paper!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               <h5> What if I don’t get an internship?</h5>
                        
                                Keep trying and know that everyone goes through this disappointment.
                                It is ok, you are not stupid or anything else just because you didn’t get an internship.
                                Still keep trying and if nothing else works, pick a topic you want to explore and do an independent project.
                                In the meantime, it would be worthwhile thinking about what you can improve on in your search process.
                                You can still look into a research project for your BTP (BTech project).
                                Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.
                                If you feel isolated, have no one to share your research interest with, and thus, are looking for a research community, Twitter is a great place for it!

                               <h5>What is Kaggle?</h5>
                          The Session kicked off with a brief introduction of Kaggle i.e., an online community of data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

                                <h5>How to go about Working with Datasets</h5>
                                This was shortly followed by the discussion of steps to be kept in mind while working with datasets. The various steps are listed as follows:
                                <br>1. Understanding and identifying the type of problem.
                                <br>2. Loading the dataset and necessary modules.
                                <br>3. Carrying out EDA to gain insights from the given data (this involves the preprocessing of closely observing the existing data, analyzing it and gaining insights from it).
                                <br>4. Carrying out data pre-Processing.
                                <br>5: Building and evaluating a model. 
                                
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               <h5>Building and Evaluating the Model</h5> 
                                Furthermore, the various topics under building and evaluation a Machine Learning model specifically a Breast Cancer model which was demonstrated by Krutika were discussed which are summarized as followed:<br>
                               <br>1.Linear Regression: A supervised Learning algorithm that performs the task to predict a dependent variable value based on a given independent variable. A cost function is usually used to predict a particular output in this type of model. In the Breast-cancer model the Mean Squared error function is being used. <br>
                                <br> 2.Logistic Regression: A supervised machine Learning algorithm used to determine the particular class to which a datapoint belongs. It is implemented when the target variable is categorical in nature. A sigmoid function is used to obtain the desired output in the Breast-cancer model.<br>
                                <br> 3.Support Vector Machines: A type of supervised ML Algorithm which is mostly used for classification problems but can also be applied to regression models. Each data item plotted as a point in n-dimensional space with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Thus, classification can be performed by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes very well. The hyperplane is chosen such that it maximizes the margin between the given two points. SVMs can be used for both linearly separable as well as non-linearly separable data points. <br>
                                <br>4. Random Forest: A supervised Learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. It is also a type of Ensemble Learning technique. Ensemble Learning is a machine learning Technique that combines many base models to create one robust optimal model which gives accurate results. It is an ensemble of many decision trees. All weak classifiers come together to make a strong classifier. While making predictions all the trees vote for the class they predict and then the class that secures the majority votes is taken as the final prediction.<br>
                               <br> 5. Artificial Neural Networks: A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way human brain operates. Similar to neurons in the human brain, ANNs consist of perceptrons which form the basic units of a neural network. Any ANN consists of 4 components namely:<br>
                                <br>a.) Input Values 
                                <br>b.) Weights and bias 
                                <br>c.) Cost function
                                <br>d.) Activation
                                <br>The Above algorithms and Evaluation methods were discussed with regards to the Breast Cancer Prediction model and the Gap minder dataset both of which were discussed in a detailed and comprehensive manner.

                                Give yourself a strong foundation. This includes doing appropriate coursework such as Stanford’s ML course by Andrew Ng, IBM’s Machine Learning with Python, Google’s Machine Learning Crash Course and reference books such as Jerome Freidman. Following this, one can delve further into Deep Learning by doing courses such as the Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera and Yann LeCun’s course on deep learning, as well as from the Deep Learning book by Ian Goodfellow. DataCamp has hands-on experience for further practice.

                                After doing the courses, you need to apply your skills to understand the workflow better. This can be done through implementing proof of concepts, practicing an entire machine learning workflow- from data collection right up to evaluation, practicing on real datasets from Kaggle, UCI, Google Datasets etc and then you may dive deeper into further topics.
                                
                                Some building blocks in a ML application include data preprocessing, sampling and splitting, supervised/unsupervised learning, model evaluation, ensemble learning, bias variance trade-off, hyperparameter tuning and optimizations. Tools such as Pandas(handling of datasets), Scikit-Learn(implementing ML models), Numpy(to handle numerical data), Beautifulsoup(for scraping data through websites) and Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualisation packages) are useful python packages.

                                Projects such as Titanic Challenge, House Price prediction, Hand digit recognition, facial key points can be done. Implement algorithms from scratch to understand how the algorithm works. Implementation of research papers can be found on an archive called PapersWithCode. After this one should be ready to participate in online hackathons, kaggle competitions. Stanford’s CS 229 course is a good resource to get project ideas and implementations.

                                While going through research papers make your own incremental changes in the application, this can be done by using other algorithms and the results can be recorded and documented in order to write a research paper. Good research papers are available at various sources online, including arXiv, NeurIPS as well a few noted conferences etc.
                                
                                Ashish mentioned a few projects done by him including a <u> visual assistant for visually impaired,</u> ,<u>detection of fake reviews on online review platforms,</u> <u> and help desk intelligent chatbot.</u> He described the customer support chatbot in detail. Named Desker, it was an automated answering system to assist customers in resolving their problems faster. His techstack included python, tensorflow, mongodb, django, reactJS, Ajax.
                                
                                The chatbot had a prebuilt predictive model connected to a database which contained a list of possible questions and responses, and context information.

                                Companies look for AI and some subject matter expertise. Many non-cs backgrounds have applications in AI, this can also give one an edge in the job market. There is no need to switch careers, AI can be learnt alongside.
                                <br>
                                Ashish then stressed the importance of profile building and networking required. Having a portfolio with your skills can help you with your job prospects. This can be done by making a portfolio website, creating a resume, participation in hackathons, publishing papers, writing blogs and giving talks, documenting projects on GitHub. Networking can be done through channels like twitter, discord, linkedin, conferences etc.

He completed his undergraduate degree from VIT Pune and received an off campus placement at Credit Suisse, where he now works as a technology analyst. In this session, Affan gave an insight to off campus placements, internships, job opportunities and his journey of grabbing a job.

                        <b>Resume</b>
                        <p>
                        The first important step in an off campus placement process is Resume. Every job description has a basic job qualification section, where they mention their requirements such as third year student, final year student etc. and your eligibility has to reflect in your resume, by mentioning your year of graduation. You can add your linkedin profile, github repo, objectives, education, internship experience(corporate). Add projects that you have done, which should ideally be covering a variety of techstack, and which shows you as a developer. One must also add curriculars, extra- curriculars and important achievements that make you stand-out. Extra curriculars may include managing a club, conducting a conference etc.
                        
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Affan points out that you should be able to measure your work, for instance you can mention the impact your project has created or how many people are using your work and highlight these measurements. Resumes can be written using Latex. Overleaf.com provides good templates for the same. The first stage in a placement process is a screening round, which is done using resumes.

                        Your problem solving skills and ability to express your thought process to your interviewers is important. You should be able to explain the time complexity, space complexity, the approach etc. To gain the problem solving ability one must do competitive coding and data structures & algorithms.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Other important aspects are aptitude, projects, core subjects ( Object Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, DBMS, Computer Networks).

                        <p>
                        You should be acquainted with both C++and Java, and master at least one of them.

                        <p>
                        Next, learn data structures. Create a list of all data structures you know, and analyse the topics you are lacking, and try to work on these. Recognise patterns in problems and relate it to concepts you know. After clearing the basics, move on to advanced data structures.

                        <p>
                        Affan suggests creating your own area for interview preparation where you can update your progress, store notes, important concepts etc. He also suggests using softwares like google docs for coding without auto-complete features, to help you to build your syntax. Try writing a clean code.
                        
                        Create a list of questions which you found tough while practicing. Go through these tough questions and solutions before the interview. Also go through these problems every week till it builds the logic inside you. This helps overcome the fear of difficult problems.
                        
                        Practice explaining the logic and concepts, by verbally speaking it out. Take many mocks and go through resume stories of different people. This helps in predicting the interview. Take a project, put it in a real life situation and try to predict the problems that can arise. Start criticizing your projects, the shortfalls and answer these questions. For instance, why this algorithm, why not that approach, why is the dataset small, why is your project not deployed etc.

                        Try to understand what a problem wants to teach you. Start solving medium and hard problems. At every point in your practice there should be something that is challenging.
                        
                        In the interview, talk about other approaches to the problem asked to you. Which approaches will work, and which won’t.

                        <p>
                        After the screening round, the next stage is the coding round. Generally, 60-70 people are shortlisted out of 800 students. There are three types of coding rounds: only MCQs, only Coding or both. Keep a track of time while solving coding questions. Dont assume what the problem is. Check all the constraints first. Read the entire problem at least twice before you start coding.
                        
                        For Oops, OS, DBMS, CN- begin your preparation with your original notes and then move on to other resources. Check the most asked questions on these topics. For aptitude, go through formulas from Cheat Sheets, R.S. Agarwal.

                        The virtual interview basics:
                        
                        Affan suggests trying to look at the camera during the interview. Be habitual with using google docs for writing codes. Type while looking at the camera, and try to keep the interaction. Record the way you speak in front of the camera and analyse yourself.
                        
                        Affan gave some useful tips for solving a competitive coding question in the interview:
                        
                        Reiterate the question asked to you by the interviewer and tell him what you understood from it, to be on the same page. Specify to the interviewer the assumptions you consider on your own, such as if the input will be only positive numbers, or if size of array shouldnt be empty, time and space constraints if any etc. If your interpretation is wrong, the interviewer will correct you. While giving the solution, first specify the algorithm you will be using. If the interviewer agrees to the constraints, complexity etc only then move ahead and code the solution. Debug the code, have dry runs, find bugs, generate your test cases which wont work etc. Give a brute force as well as an optimised solution. After you give a solution, you can also suggest alternative techniques to solve the problem, such as using different data structures etc.
                        
                        Modularization of code is important.
                        
                        Write generic functions instead of writing different tasks in main. Divide your code into parts and make it reusable.
                        </p>
                        
                        <u>
                        How to get unstuck?
                        </u>
                        <p>
                        If you get stuck while solving a problem, not down the steps that you are taking to come to the solution. Dry run edge cases, base cases to devise the initial algorithm. Use test cases that are going to fail the algorithm, and understand how to modify the algorithm.
                        
                        Check the properties of data structures you are using and what fits for the solution.
                        
                        Relate the question to any template or any standard questions you have solved. Affan suggests that based on the input size and total possible time complexity of the compiler, you can figure out if the subproblem is to be divided and what the problem actually wants you to solve. Repetition in dynamic programming can be done for further optimisations. He also suggests doing Reverse Engineering - take an output, figure out the range of input values possible and if they satisfy the constraints.

                        Tech/ Open Source work gets you an interview while fundamentals, OOPS, competitive coding help you crack the interview. Geeksforgeeks, leetcode are good sources to prepare for the interview. Affan does not advise to do courses explicitly for learning techstacks but to learn them based on how much is required for your projects. While building projects, build products.

                        An internship is nothing but an extended interview. You can apply for summer internships, semester internships or year long internships.He advises to not target direct placements by skipping internships. Check the PPO rate a company has, and start individual preparation for placements in case it’s low. Know what you wish to do long term, and make plans accordingly. It might differ if targeting for GATE, or masters, or govt jobs etc.
                        
                        This information is available on whatsapp and telegram groups which you can find online. Check where the alumni of your college are working for guidance. You can also find recruiters on linkedin. Talk to recruiters of companies to understand the hiring processes and check if your profile is inline. Youtube is a great resource for finding opportunities. Search #hiring and #offcampus on linkedin to find openings. Have a strong student network.

                                Manpreet started with explaining some basic terms commonly used in NLP. A word is a basic atomic unit of meaning. A single word in itself does not hold any meaning but the words around it give it a meaning. Manpreet then introduced the Max Match Algorithm. Corpus ia collection of text. This algorithm matches a word letter by letter with the corpus. When a sequence of letters matches, it is interpreted as a word. For example in speech recognition where there is no explicit word boundary information given within a continuous speech utterance. The minimum edit distance between two strings is defined as the minimum number of editing operations ( like insertion, deletion, substitution) needed to transform one string to another. It is used in automatic spelling correction, in bioinformatics etc

                                Python is the preferred language to train NLP models and NLTK is the most used library to preprocess the data.<b> Tokenization </b> is the act of breaking up a sequence of strings into pieces such as words, symbols and other elements called tokens. The text is tokenized using the sentence_tokenizer function of nltk. It divides the sentence based on the period in the sentence. You may also tokenize using punctuation marks such as commas. Next remove stopwords from the text. These are the commonly used words such as ‘a’ ‘an’ ‘the’. Next, she implemented the minimum edit <u> distance between two random words. </u> A python library is available for this.

                                Parts of Speech are required to understand what type of grammatical structure the words represent. There are two types of words, content words and function words. The content words are generally nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs. The function words are generally pronouns, prepositions, coordinating conjunctions, interjections, determiners. Manpreet used the nltk library for finding the pos tags of the words.
                                </p>

                                Regular Expressions are used for generating passwords, validation of email etc. Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. This can be implemented using the re library in python. Manpreet implemented this for finding ‘the’, ‘The’, ‘whitespaces’, etc in a text data.<b> Morphology </b> is the study of the way words are built up from smaller meaning units called MORPHEMES, Two broad classes are:
                                </p>
                                <ol type="1">
                                <li>stems- root word</li>

                                <p>
                                <b>Text segmentation </b> is the process of dividing written text into meaningful units, such as words, sentences or topics. This is used in information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and document clustering.
                                </p>
                          
                                <p>
                                Stemming and lemmatization are two important preprocessing techniques. There are two types of stemming
                                </p>
                               <ul>
                               <li> <b> Porter stemmer : </b> it doesn’t often generate stems that are actual english words and it is known for its simplicity and speed
                                </li>
                                <li> <b> 
                                lancaster stemmer:  </b> it is an iterative algorithm where each rule specifies either a deletion or replacement of an ending. It is simple but may lead to over-stemming.
                              </li> 
                              </ul> 
                              
                                <p>
                                Manpreet demonstrated how stemming can create noise in the data and thus the need for lemmatization arises.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Zipf’s law is a discrete probability distribution that tells you the probability of encountering a word in a given corpus. The input is the rank of the word in terms of its total frequency. Language modeling is predicting the next word based on the previous words. This is widely used in google search, gmail, and messaging. Models that assign probabilities to sequences of words are called Language Models. The assumption that the probability of a word depends only on the previous word is called a <u> Markov Assumption. </u> Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams are used to find frequency of words. Manpreet advises to take datasets on kaggle and start working on them. She also suggests some projects for beginners such as text mining, sentiment analysis using BERT, Transformers, LSTMs, RNN, question answer generation, machine translation etc.

                                The fourth and the final session of AICVS 2.0 was conducted on 8th April 2021 on Spark AR, by Rutuja Kolhe. Rutuja is a technical analyst at CitiBank. She is a Machine Learning and Augmented Reality enthusiast. She is the recipient of Facebook School of Innovation on Augmented Reality Program. In this session, Rutuja talked about Augmented Reality, shared basic types of realities, AR, VR, their characteristics, Snapchat filters and her experience at the Facebook School of Innovation on Augmented Reality Program.
                                
                                Rutuja started by giving a basic introduction on Augmented Reality. It is the technology that expands our physical world by adding layers of digital information to the reality in forms of layers. AR has the possibility to change the way through which we interact with the world. The first released concept belongs to Ivan Sutherland in 1968 when he created the first HUD gear called Sword of Damocles. This term was first coined in the 1990s. AR now finds its applications in entertainment, medicine, education, retail, fashion, jewellery, business etc. AR is an upcoming technology and is projected to reach $72.7 billion by 2024, thus creating more opportunities for creativity. Installed user base for AR supported mobile devices is more than 1.5 Billion.
                                
                                
                                    </p>
                                
                                    <p>
                                What makes AR better?
                                It gives more natural and intuitive actions as opposed to external input devices. It has the ability to use the whole space to interact and operate the experience in. Lightweight headsets are now being introduced to allow for hands free movement. With just hand gestures, it is easy to use. It also has the ability to hide when not in use.
                                
                                Augmented and virtual reality are two completely different terms. Virtual reality is a simulated and immersive expense projected by a device into the user’s sight. It can take you into a completely virtual world, such as Hogwarts! But in VR, you may lose a connection with the real world. VR requires a set of lenses inside a viewport on a hackset and a mounted device where the experience is stored or computed. Some competitors in VR include Google, Samsung, oculus, Sony PlayStation, HTC.
                                
                                On the other hand Augmented reality superimposes a computer generated image on a user’s physical view of the real world. Such experiences can be seen as social with several users being present in the saame space consuming the same augmented content. VR takes you to a different world while AR brings that world to you. There are two key elements required in AR. First is the camera to capture the environment around you as you move and second is the software that calculates and projects some computer generated visuals or content.
                                 </p>
                                
                                 <p>
                                    Mixed reality is a hybrid of VR and AR and aims to offer the best of both worlds. It is highly interactive and adds a realistic rendering of the projection to our surroundings.
                                 </p>
                                
                                 <p>
                                    There are two kinds of AR experience
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Static Augmented Reality Experiences</li>
                                    
                                    <li>Interactive Augmented Reality Experiences</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    In the Static Augmented Reality Experiences the user is viewing the digital content on their smartphone and mainly interacting with it though simple physical gestures. It is termed static since it reacts to only gestures and doesn’t make the user perform actions or move around in the environment. For eg filters on the phone. In the Interactive Augmented Reality Experiences the user is actively moving around in the real world and interacting with the digital elements placed around. These are comparatively difficult to implement.
                                 </p>
                                
                                 <p>
                                 Marker Based AR requires a special visual object and a camera to scan it, such as a printed QR code to special signs and it’s like image recognition. This is very easy to implement. This can be used for drones to decide where they are going to land. Markerless AR are also called location based ARs and work using GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass etc. This AR then determines what content you get in a certain area. Projection AR involves projecting synthetic light to physical surfaces. Superimposition AR replaces the original view with augmented reality. Object recognition plays a key role in this. Eg Ikea- you can arrange chairs in your living room.
                                
                                 Rutuja then talked about layers in Augmented reality. Scene Understanding involves detection of planes to detect surface of walls, floors etc. This is done through camera image. Tracking is the relationship between the real and digital world. Rendering is the way a digital object is represented on the device when it is placed in the real world. It involves showing accurate representations of the materials present in the object as well as representation of the same lighting conditions as the environment.
                                 
                                 Few challenges in AR include creating content, display issues, performance issues. But despite this, it is expected to open up a new form of computing called Spatial Computing.
                                 </p>
                                
                                 <p>
                                 Spark AR is an augmented reality platform that allows you to create AR effects for mobile cameras. It is GUI friendly and can be built with or without code. Visual programming aids in adding interactivity. Customisations can be one using coding. Objects and sounds can be easily imported on this platform. SparkAR can be used for facebook and instagram while LensStudio can be used for snapchat. Spark AR also gives some templates to start with.
                                 
                                 School of Innovation is powered by Facebook with the aim of giving students an opportunity to learn and create their own experience using SparkAI. They do not require any kind of experience and teach everything from scratch. It consists of 5 steps- MCQ round, Interview Round, On-Boarding, 11 week course and a Capstone Project. Rutuja did her capstone project with Unicef. She added some effects like the Silly Clown Filter, Soar into the Sky, Hands_20, Rogue. Some course highlights include that its industry is curated, close guidance, support, industry relevance. Facebook measures the performance using the number of times the filter has been used, number of times the picture has been saved and the number of shares the filter got.
                                 
                                 Rutuja encourages everyone interested to create their own filters!

                                The session started with Jinal sharing her failures. She faced two major failures. The First one was She studied directly for the advanced in the hope that if she studied for advanced she could do well in mains. And the second was she limited herself to limited subjects.

                                The next failure she faced was when she got under the influence of start ups. She along with her team made it till the last round but they failed in it the reason was lack of perseverance and lack of support from the people. But she learned the importance of teamwork and leadership skill from it and most importantly she learned to face rejections. She then learned that she should be prepared to face any consequences that life gives her.She taught us that no matter what the only thing continues is the urge to develop your skills.

                                   <h5>Applying IKIGAI in life</h5>
                                   
                                    <p>
                                    IKIGAI is a Japanese word which refers to having a direction or purpose in life, that which makes one’s life worthwhile, and towards which an individual takes spontaneous and willing actions giving them satisfaction and a sense of meaning to life.
                                    </p>    
                                    
                                    It contains words like passion, profession, vocation and mission. So the word IKIGAI is the combination of these words.Profession is when you are good at something and are getting paid for it, passion is you do something you love even if unpaid, when you are getting paid for something and the world needs it then it is vocation and when you love something and the world also needs it then you are on a mission. And when you combine all these we get is IKIGAI ,which is a lifetime process all that depends on skills ,if you are good at it and you love it then we know what our IKIGAI is. 
                                    
                                </p>

                                 <h5>What is Skill and Skill Assessment?</h5>
                                    
                                    <strong>Skills</strong> are what you get when you put in your efforts, hard work and develop them with continuous practice.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Skill Assessment</strong> is the most widely applied means to review or check on your skills.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Check out the presentation to know about the what is skill and skill assessment. The skill assessment test is important because employees are the company’s asset. When companies hire you the usually consider what are you good at ,what are your skills and how do you develop them ,soft skills etc and many students apply for this. So companies take Skill Assessment test to choose between the students which are good at not only technical knowledge but also skills to cope with wide range of people.And it is important because employees are their assets as they know because of them the company will grow world wide.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>What does this skill set include ?</strong>
                                    Skill is an infinite set and the skills one should evolve depends on the company you’ve applied for. The basic skill-set include soft skills, technical knowledge, loyalty and diversity. The main and most important skills are soft skills and technical knowledge. Don’t be a one trick pony. Dare to take risks
                                </p> 
                                   
                                <p>
                                    <h5>Soft Skills</h5>
                                    In technical terms soft skills are the skills of problem solving, thinking creatively, communicating and acting ethically. Soft skills are teachable now-a-days. Some of the common soft skills are communication ,team-player, leadership skills, positive attitude and perseverance. One of the soft skill sis excellent communicator and presenter.We have service based economy and all we have is human interaction. And to develop this we need to take part in various events ,join NGO’s and clubs like AICVS ,TedxCummins ,codeclub etc. We should reach out to people and talk to seniors and teachers about any doubt or motivation. We can also read books and watch Hollywood movies or series which will help in gaining knowledge some or the other way.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong> Team player:</strong> we have to be active being an team player and always look at everything with perspective of learning and not earning. Also you should be humble with other team members and clear with the things so that you can guide your team. Also listening, grasping and coordinating are important when you are a team leader.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Leadership:</strong> This quality is most important skill looked up for placements. To develop this skill you should take up new projects. As companies have many projects and they look up for this skill so that you can work with many people and you are adaptable and dynamic and can work with teams. Also be a good listener.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Other soft skills are positive attitude and perseverance.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>How does this affect placement? </strong><br> The skill test is very important. Usually students find a job, make resume, and submit a google form and then there is skill test form. We usually don’t take this seriously and then we get rejection. We should not take skill assessment test lightly . we should rather take time and study about it and look at the answers at hacckerrank and gfg and prepare unique answers using star method which includes writing down the points like background, advantages and actions and impact of that task. to know more check the presentation.
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    Lastly she stated the Importance of diversity and misconceptions. Diversity in career and workplace is very important and is much preferred by companies. One should be diverse enough to take up opportunities. And also do not narrow your set of diversity in skill set.

                                AICVS Cummins came up with the amazing concept of webinars to knockdown this lockdown! Through these webinar series they attempted to cover a wide range of discussions by bringing extremely talented student speakers over these 6 informative webinars. One of the webinar conducted on was spanning over the topic “Internship Approach and Scholarships” and the speaker for the same was Shristi Jalan.<br>
                                <br>
                                The speaker, Shristi Jalan, is a graduate in Information technology from Cummins College of Engineering. Shristi was a Summer Intern at Goldman Sachs for year 2019 and also the recipient of the WeTech Goldman Sachs Global Scholarship, the Mentorship Program Award and also the Cummins Scholarship. She also interned as a UI/UX developer at HACKEDEMIST. She was a participant in the Code Club at IIT Bombay. Shristi’s key interests being ML, BI, Cloud Computing, DBMS, Data Structures, she has completed many projects aligning to the same; like Chat-Bot development using Google Assistant. A Seminar based on NLP was also conducted by her. She is the Crowd Source Campus representative and was also a mentor for SWE. Her responsibilities not only being limied to that, they also include the position of Public relations Assistant held by her at a Volunteering Organization Bhumi.<br>
                                <br>
                                Shristi at her attempt to bridge the gap between the juniors and the Alumni of the College guided the juniors and undergrads about how to approach internships, placements and scholarships and also had informative QnA sessions.<br>
                                <br>
                                The webinar began by very fundamentals of the topic, that is, *WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE FOR INTERNSHIPS AND PLACEMENTS? Shristi explained the entire process very briefly yet made it extremely easy to understand and brought in the required clarity for the same. Checking notice board frequently and emails from the TnP cell, the company PPTs (Pre-Placement Talks), Online tests/ Coding rounds which include coding, logic, quants, Techical Interview rounds, HR round and GD were the prompt steps she mentioned.</p>
                                <br>
                                Moving ahead in the webinar she touched upon the very crucial and persistent question among the undergrads – <strong>HOW TO BEGIN WITH CODING?</strong> Many useful resources were mentioned by her in order to resolve this question. She suggested CS50 – online course by Harvard , which takes us through the basics of the coding languages and lays a sound foundation to start coding. She stressed upon not underestimating the college courses and lab assignments, which many if the undergrads tend to do :P. She also mentioned YouTube as a big help in this process as it has a lot of free and self-paced courses/channels which all the undergrads can take up easily. She also mentioned the resources like Udacity and Coursera which come into picture when basic are in place!
                                <br><br>
                                Next up she went on the taboo question –<strong> WHAT IF I AM A NON CS STUDENT?</strong> “No barrier of the branch” said Shristi just as she began to address this question. Lot of companies are looking for and offering jobs related to CS to the people of varied domains who don’t belong to CS background. The effort put in by these people is a bit more than the CS students but that just worth it when you receive the job of your liking! Practice is the key she mentioned and suggested Geeks For Geeks as a useful platform for the same. She also suggested the build on additional Mathematical knowledge and other E&TC projects including IoT would be a great asset in this journey of a NON CS to CS job!
                                <br><br>
                                Covering about –<strong> WHAT ETCHNICAL SKILLS ARE NEEDED?</strong> She mentioned basic math and logic will take you a long way in the process and benefit you largely in the placement process. Although the skills demanded by the companies could be specific to company, there are a few key technical skills that are common to all– Problem solving, Data Structures and Algorithms, DBMS, Operating Systems and Networking. In short, the curriculum of 3 – 4 undergrad years at college! :P She then covered the a very crucial point – WHAT LANGUAGE IS PREFFERED? In which she conveyed clearly any and every programming language which you are comfortable with works fine. Personally she recommended Python and Java. Do not switch between languages frequently was a key take away from this point and addition to that was using online coding platforms like Hackerrank. She also talked about WHAT IS THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL OF CODE? which is very specific to the company. In general, she mentioned the difficulty level lies between medium to hard and the evaluation factors could be number of test cases cleared and optimization (although the evaluation metrics might change according to companies, every year). She personally recommended to begin with C and then move on to Java, C++, Python and basic coding logic always stays the same irrespective of the language used! DO’s AND DON’Ts were also specified by her while doing your preparation which provided a lot of insights to the undergrads on what should be their approach for all this and gave them a clear picture of what they should not do! (Memorizing the code being on the top of the DON’Ts list). She also shared some tips on how to manage the preparation when you have less time in hand for preparation, which obviously helped a lot to the juniors from time management perspective!
                                <br><br>
                                Moving on Shristi gave valuable tips on RESUME - DO’s AND DON’Ts which covered key points like keeping your resume ready well in advance, and the only main take away of this point was – <strong> DO NOT LIE ABOUT ANY POINT IN YOUR RESUME, BE HONEST WITH WHAT YOU HAVE ON IT AND KEEP IT CONCISE!</strong> While she talked about COMPANY BACKGROUND PREPARATION, she suggested checking out company website, their products and services, domains the work in, their LinkedIn updates, and knowing about founders and prominent leaders in the company.
                                <p>
                                    <h5>WHAT COMPANIES LOOK FOR?</h5>
                                    In general, Shristi mentioned honest, hardworking people with sound problem solving and communication skills and ability to work as a team player were all the major qualities companies look for while they hire students. Technical rounds might vary in number and pattern she mentioned, as they are subject to a particular company and their way of executing hiring process. Main tips for these from Shristi’s end for this were – think but think out loud and explain the logic and then start working on the code. WHAT TYPE OF QUESTIONS COULD BE ASKED? Is again a company specific point she mentioned but again gave a generalized idea about the range of questions – from array manipulation to Dynamic programming, from stack to queue to trees spanning over entire the data structure and algorithms! Another important tip received from her end was on HOW TO TACKLE A SITUATION WHERE YOU DON’T KNOW AN ANSWER? – It is okay to not know the answer, just accept it gracefully and take them through your thought process and explain as much as you know! You might even be right! :P But do not lie and sound overconfident in such situation, mentioned Shristi. Also, she touched upon a major common questions of HR rounds like INTRODUCE YOURSELF, WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN 5 YEARS, WHY SHOULD WE HIRE YOU and gave really very useful inputs on the same! Being honest, confident, vocal about your strengths at the same time being aware of your own weaknesses, and leaving a good first impression were the key take away points from this. And she suggested to definitely go for asking questions to the interviewer, given a chance for the same. Do not shy away and stay quiet! Express your curiosity in a subtle way and channel it well via professional guidelines. WHAT IS THE KEY TO CONFIDENCE? – Shristi mentioned confidence is not an inborn quality, it a product of your struggles and challenges you’ve overcame! It is a learnable skill, which comes with preparedness and practice. Being aware of strengths contributes largely to it :)
                                    <br><br>
                                    Lastly, Shristi took up some questions and took time to address each one of it in detail and gave more ‘cherries on cake’ with every questions! Check out the webinar for getting to know the same! To end this webinar, Shristi fondly said few genuine words for the undergrads and subtly got the crux of the entire session in these – Be patient, confident and honest - it takes you a long way, be positive and interactive. Practice well and attempt to learn always,<strong> MAINLY FROM THE PROCESS!</strong>

                                AICVS hosted its Webinar Series AICVS 1.0 with its 5th session on 11th July 2020 on <strong>“Exploring opportunities for undergrads”</strong>. The speaker for the webinar was Chaitanyasuma Jain.
                                <br><br>
                                Chaitanyasuma is the recipient of the Goldman Sachs WeTech ‘19 scholarship, and Avery Dennison InvEnt 2018 scholarship. She is a former WiDS volunteer and also started and currently runs, our college level coding club called “ Loop” and was the coordinator for a STEM outreach initiative with Teach for India, Pune. She secured an internship at Deutsche Bank and was also selected for the University of Notre Dame research fellowship at Indiana, USA, through college. And due to the pandemic she is currently working with a Bangalore-based start-up. She along with her team, has previously presented their research work at a national-level conference organised by ISRO at SAC, Ahmedabad. She is also an open source contributor and an avid hackathon participant. In this session, she guided us with opportunities that we can grasp as undergrads, from open source and volunteering to projects and internships.
                                <br><br>
                                The session started with Chaitanyasuma sharing her successes and failures and agenda of the session – <strong>“Understanding and Exploring the opportunities on your own.”</strong> Being a FY or SY student ,we don’t explore many opportunities but it can be done by joining college clubs and participating in the hackathon and doing projects and also the internship programs. She started explaining about organisations and volunteering. She said we should associate with various clubs like IEEE ,AICVS ,Rotaract as these clubs provide us benefits like access to resources ,projects ,programs and conferences ,due to which we are able to explore more and connect with peers and do meaningful work.
                                <br><br>
                                Chaitanyasuma then put forward the idea of <strong>projects and hackathons</strong>. Hackathons are the best way to learn about innovation, building applications, and working as a team in a high-pressure environment like hackathons have and also understanding business aspects of an idea. She also added some notable contests for working on projects like Avery Dennison Scholarship, DSC solution challenge ,IBM Call for Code etc . where we can compete with people all over the world and put our idea forward.
                                <br><br>
                                She also explained about Open Source. Open Source is basically a term that is originally referred to open source software (OSS). OSS is a code that is designed to be publicly accessible which can be read, modified and everyone can contribute to it even if you are not a student . She stated some popular Open Source sites like GitHub and Bitbucket. There are several Open Source programs and they follow a common structure which includes
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Community Bonding – interaction with mentors from the organisations as they are in need of the developers who can contribute to that code. So you should understand the code ,know the program in detail and should ask doubts and clear it.</li>
                                    <li>Applications -Select projects you are interested in. And you need to come up with some ideas for the program and draft the proposal with your idea and send it. And on this basis you are selected to work on the program.</li>
                                    <li>Coding- here you actually need to code and contribute to their code repositories.</li>
                                    <li>Review- Final review of your work after which you’ll get stipend and certificates if the work qualifies . She mentioned few Open Source programs like Google Summer of Code,Outreachy, Season of KDE,Foss Asia,Rails Girls Summer of Code and the starting dates and the coding periods of these programs in the slides whose link is below.</li>
                                    
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                Moving on to <strong> Internship Programs</strong> ,she explained what can one do as an undergraduate intern. She added one should do 4 things in 4 summers of the engineering namely
                                <ol>
                                <li>Contributing to Open Source</li>
                                <li>Working with a start-up</li>
                                <li>Working under a professor and contribute to their research</li>
                                <li>Lastly working at a Corporate and gaining industry experience. She mentioned some International Research Programs , research at Indian Institutes and corporate internship opportunities in the slides. Some of these programs are exclusive and people from all over the world applies for it and so you need to make your application very strong in terms of statement of purpose and in terms of research you’ve pursued independently. Cold emailing is emailing the organization directly by visiting the website and finding their faculty associated with computer labs and their researches and specifying your interest in the particular field. She mentioned cold emailing should continue till you the thing you have interest in even if you fail may time. Lastly, she explained about placements. She stated, there are many off-campus placements opportunities too which you should ask about to your seniors as it gives the chance to apply if you have missed one or the other company. You can also get placements through contests like Infosys and also through referrals when you ask someone to refer you to a company and be approached, she added. For the preparation, her advice was competitive coding is must. Also projects and good balance of academic and co-curricular activities also matter.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <br>

                                I vividly remember myself at the beginning of second year without any experience with python or how to use an IDE. I was anxious about git, and didn't know much about it. I did want to learn, but the question remained - how? Most of us have been at points where we want to learn something new and are just puzzled about where to start. With so many resources available, it's hard to decide how to spend our time. We can't even know what quality is if we don't know what is good and what isn't. For the most part, what I learned from that point onwards I have to give a huge credit to all the people who mentored me, because without them navigating this maze would have been impossible.
                        
                        
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>
                        
                               After reflecting on my journey so far I think one of the things that has been really important is choosing an appropriate mentor. This has helped me to get where I wanted to go.
                        
                        
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <h5>Finding a new direction</h5>
                             At the start I figured it would be wise to experiment without any directions. But, after taking a bunch of courses in Machine Learning, It took me a while to figure out the best way to learn, but I finally realised that it's better not just to experiment on my own, but also to get advice from other professionals in the field. I believe the time I spent at ML meet-ups during that period helped. I was able to interact with people who were discussing their real, relevant problems and how they tried to tackle them. I was more aware of the applications ML can be applied to. When you're starting out, it's crucial to know what people are focusing on, or if there are any problems that this tool can help with. This will allow you to hone in on your skills and know how you want to specialize.
                        
                            </p>
                            Just around this time, I reached out to people in the meet-ups groups if they were looking for interns/would anyone be interested in taking me up as a mentee. I got an internship with Crysagi Systems, and honestly I cannot begin to describe how much I learnt through that experience. I learned how to use git and to wield its powers. I learned the basics of software development life cycles and how to debug code. After this point, I had been doing internships alongside college and kept a journal of everything new that I learnt. Maintaining a journal helped me get good feedback for myself based on the experiments I did.

                              <h5>Internship and its experiences</h5>
                               I interned at Verloop in 2019 (at the end of my 6th semester) and during the time I developed an interest in Natural Language Processing.I loved the potential of gaining information from text and learning how to manipulate algorithms to understand languages. Verloop is a start-up in Bangalore focusing on conversational AI. I mostly worked on systems that detected the different entities in texts across languages. One of the important aspects I focused on at Verloop were low-resource languages and training models which perform well and provide low latency. I've had a lot of support here with a great bunch of mentors. That's really helped me to get on and do some good work - it's pushed me to speak at meet-ups and even encouraged me to focus more on research which lead to an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09820">ACL Publication about Hinglish Tweet sentiment analysis</a>. I believe the main thing was having someone with more faith in me than I had in myself. I loved being put out of my comfort zone and pushing myself to be the best version of myself.

                                I believe the main thing was having someone with more faith in me than I had in myself. I loved being put out of my comfort zone and pushing myself to be the best version of myself. I later joined Verloop as an ML engineer and focused on learning more about the domain and how to create solutions in the problem space with keeping constraints in mind.
                        
                                I've been working for <a href="https://www.hunters.ai/">Hunters.ai</a>, an Israeli Cybersecurity Startup, for the past couple of months. Learning new things is an integral part of my work here. Machine Learning at hunters aims at enhancing the way we detect new leads for an attack; employing these algorithms to detect anomalies which
                                could be a sign of an attack.
                        
                            </p>
                        <h5>Knowledge is Power</h5>
                            It would be naive to underestimate the power of luck & randomness in every field, but I also think that a need to constantly learn new things helped me a lot. I've been trying to get better by experimenting, trying new things and talking to people who have more experience. For me, one of the mental models I follow is understanding my <a href="https://fs.blog/circle-of-competence/">circle of competence</a>.
                        
                                    “When you're familiar with something and you’ll also know the limits of your knowledge.
                        If you want to improve your odds of success in life and business, then define the perimeter of your circle of competence, and operate inside. Over time, work to expand that circle but never fool yourself about where it stands today, and never be afraid to say “I don’t know.”
                        
                        When you reach these "I don't know"s interact with people who have deeper understanding of the subject and learn from them.

                                Having a 9 pointer throughout your 4 years of engineering should never be your sole aim, rather having
                        exposure to 9 different opportunities should be your goal. Engineering today is about what you learn and
                        how you grow apart from classroom teaching rather than just clearing your semesters without a backlog
                        and Eaton’s Pratibha excellency award validates the same fact. It is a scholarship award offered by Eaton
                        that recognizes exceptional women engineering students from leading engineering institutions in India
                        that assess the candidates on academic as well as co-curricular achievements.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most fascinating aspect of this award that should drive you towards participating in this opportunity is
                                not just the monetary reward but also the fact that it is offered to only two colleges from Maharashtra! This
                                award gives the participant an excellent chance to assess and to think about problems and their solutions
                                from an industrial perspective. You should be a final or pre-final year student studying in any of the
                                information and communication technology branches to compete for the award.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The process of the award is divided into two stages namely the application round and the paper
                        presentation round. A short orientation about the same is conducted prior by the company so make sure
                        you do attend that and get all your doubts cleared about the entire process. In case you are wondering
                        about the details of the orientation program then keep a lookout for the mail from your college’s
                        placement cell, they’ve a plethora of opportunities waiting to be grabbed by each one of you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next comes the application form which is your first step towards the award. There’s only one line for your
                        cgpa and the rest 2 pages are about your involvements in technical and non-technical activities so you
                        can assess for yourself how important being involved in college fests, clubs, tech teams is. If you are a
                        club member or a head, if you have won or participated in a sports activity, if you have coordinated an
                        event during your college’s technical or cultural fest or volunteered for any activity then write all of it!
                        Because the more programs you have been a part of the more your chances are to be shortlisted for the
                        next and final round. Another highly important factor that is in fact the deciding criteria for the next round
                        is your community involvement. If you’ve been a part of any NGO or youth organization that works
                        towards upliftment of underprivileged in the society then highlight it as glamorously as you can because
                        this award looks for girls who not just grow individually but also help the society grow as a whole too.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The last and the final round-paper is the paper presentation round. About 10 students from each college
                        get shortlisted based on their application and resume. You will receive a mail from Eaton regarding the
                        next steps which basically involves you choosing a topic for your presentation. These topics are provided
                        by the company and are different for computer science and non-computer science branches. Choosing a
                        theme which you like shouldn’t be the only reason why you select a topic rather I would suggest you
                        choose a theme that not just matches your liking but has a great future prospect in the industry as well.
                        More specifically how Eaton could benefit from your solution. Often certain topics already have a lot of
                        applications in the market and this round assess not only your knowledge but also how innovatively can
                        you pitch in your idea or contribution towards a solution, no matter how small it is. That being said, if you
                        really do aim to win this award <b>make sure you do give solution that has your thinking in it</b> along with
                        the standard solutions because a company appreciates your effort to ideate or at least attempt to ideate a
                        solution be it correct or not. You will be given about a month’s time to research on the topic so prepare an
                        in depth solution and a power point presentation to be delivered to the Eaton executives. Stick to the topic
                        and have a detailed flow chart explaining your thought process. Ensure your ppt is <b>short and ‘to the
                        point’</b> having more figures and facts than long paragraphs, the industrial community doesn’t appreciate
                        long texts on slides, rather it should be you who explains it with key points on the slide.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rest assured remain confident about your topic and solution in those 10 minutes that you present,
                        remember the deeper you engage with the topic the better appreciated your efforts are which would also
                        help you answer the 5-minute question and answer round by the Eaton leaders on your topic. Top three
                        contestants from each college are then awarded the prestigious Eaton Pratibha scholarship award with a
                        Rs. 60,000 cash prize as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To conclude, the Eaton Pratibha award is not just a great opportunity to get yourself well-versed with
                        industrial expectations and technologies but also an amazing addition to your resume which would help
                        you stand out amongst thousands applying for the same job or university. So go ahead and refresh your
                        mailbox to see if the application process for the award has started or not!

                                I'm a final-year student working at IISER in computational biology. My previous
                                    experiences include being part of the data science team at a startup, working as a
                                    research assistant at the University of California, Irvine, to name a few. Here, I'll
                                    discuss my experiences and how undergraduate students can gain valuable work
                                    experience in the startup and academic worlds.
                            
                                    During my second year, I actively sought experience to understand what research
                                    genuinely meant, especially in the interdisciplinary fields. I also wanted to obtain
                                    work experience at a company and prepare for programming interviews for summer
                                    internships.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I discovered data science internship opportunities at various Bangalore-based
                            startups through networking and the guidance of a mentor. I applied to many
                            well-known startups and applied through a recommendation to one such Ed-Tech
                            Startup, Shunya. Inc, and received a response from the team within a few weeks. I
                            completed a take-home assignment and had a phone interview for it. Let's fast
                            forward to when I joined the team. Shunya was working on developing a
                            hyper-personalized learning platform. Our team worked on Data Science research for
                            cognitive analysis, focusing on Item Response Theory, ontology, and knowledge
                            graphs. We worked on statistical models for calculating maximum likelihood.

                                 Networking on Linkedin and Twitter and browsing AngelList, are the most effective
                            ways to find prospective startups. AngelList is a website that connects tech startups
                            looking for seed investment with investors. These are early-stage companies that
                            must develop and market their product in a fast-paced setting. Working for a startup
                            might benefit you in two ways. The first is that you have more flexibility to build the
                            product and idea from the bottom up. The second is that you deliver at pace, which
                            means you must constantly expand your skill sets and develop excellent results while
                            being mentored. Reaching out to early-stage founders and joining a startup is
                            significantly easier than going for unicorns, which require a high profile and extensive
                            work experience. (The premise is that working on a business at an early stage allows
                            you to learn more). To summarise, working in a startup helps you grow your network
                            and gain access to new opportunities while constantly honing your technical skills.

                                  I also wanted to look into academic research and what it entails, bearing in mind what
                                    higher education in the field might involve. I was actively looking for research
                                    internships and summer/winter programs during my third year. I recall missing the
                                    Mitacs Internship deadline, which prompted me to take the process seriously and
                                    explore other options. International students are not eligible for several summer
                                    research programs offered by universities abroad; instead, I discovered summer
                                    school programs such as Quantum Computing Summer Schools- QuisKit and a
                                    summer school at University College London. I was awarded a scholarship to UCL's
                                    summer school, which piqued my interest in multidisciplinary research in computer
                                    science and biology. I got to apply computational methods to solve biological
                                    problems and spent time interacting with Ph.D. students and senior researchers in the
                            
                                    field during summer school. I worked on tractography and neuroimaging. The
                                    summer school was when I discovered the numerous areas of computer science. I had
                                    the chance to work with clinicians/medics, computer scientists, mathematicians, and
                                    medical physicists who work with clinical collaborators. I realized that one doesn't
                                    need to be from a particular background to contribute to work in the field and that
                                    people from different backgrounds bring in various perspectives to work on problems.

                                 After summer school, I realized my interest in the field and the various domains of
                                    biology. Genomic mutations (genetics) piqued my interest. On reading papers and
                                    following up on ongoing research, I reached out to a few professors. In a matter of
                                    days, I received responses from three professors, and after further discussion, I began
                                    working as a research assistant in bioinformatics at the University of California,
                                    Irvine. Because bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field, I used my computational
                                    skills while also learning about the biology aspect of the problem. In the research
                                    group, I worked on neural variational inferences on TF networks. I used deep learning
                                    methods to understand the regulatory interactions between transcription factors and
                                    their target genes. I had the opportunity to lead an entire research project and
                                    contribute to another ongoing project at the time. Working at an international lab
                                    helped me build cross-cultural skills and understand how research labs in the USA
                                    work. We would have lab meetings twice a week to present our results and discuss
                                    questions related to the project. One learns teamwork skills and how to operate with
                                    different time zones, especially if it's remote work.
                            
                                    My team and I reached out to various professors in June and July this year, as we were
                                    inclined to work on a thesis as part of our final year project. We put together a list of
                                    professors in India working in the domain, reached out, and connected with a few. We
                                    had the opportunity to discuss with them and learn about the ongoing research at
                                    their labs. After a few discussions, we realized our inclination to pursue our project at
                                    IISER in the domain of computational biology.

                                  I've recently come across quite a few research opportunities in India. Microsoft
                            Research, TCS Research, and a few labs across India actively look for research interns
                            or fellows to contribute to their work and be mentored by a research scientist. It can be
                            tough to get relevant industrial and academic experience as an undergrad student, but
                            it is achievable. Find programs that accept overseas students or look for opportunities
                            by attending conferences and networking with the attendees. Reach out to people in
                            the field via LinkedIn and understand the process they took to reach there. It helps to
                            understand the skill sets needed to get particular work experience.
                            
                            The best way to get research opportunities is by discussing with your professors and
                            asking if they could recommend you to someone in the field. If not, reading papers and
                            expressing your learnings and suggestions in an email to the professors you want to
                            work with better demonstrates your interest to work under them rather than a generic
                            email asking for a research position at their lab. Professors are more likely to reply if
                            they see the student is interested in their work and has some potential ideas about it.
                            At college, we also have research internships, initiated by Dr. Sunita Jahirabadkar,
                            wherein students with similar interests as a professor, are matched to work on a
                            research project, during summer break. Reach out to the professors you would like
                            to work with and learn from, beforehand!
                            <br>
                            
                           
                            <p>
                                  I understand that it's not easy to ﬁnd your niche, but the ﬁrst step is always to identify
                            what interests you. Maybe a workshop or a particular subject intrigued you. Identify the
                            problems in the domain, potential problems that you would like to work on, and make a list.
                            Search them up on Google and Google scholar, read papers on it (just the introduction/summary
                            and the conclusion) and look at where the authors are, where they work, and their domain.
                            You might ﬁnd some professors at college interested in the same ﬁelds too, reach out for a
                            casual talk and understand their interests and point of view.
                            
                            Apart from that, corporate experience is necessary as well. Experiencing both helps
                            to reason your interests and understand your goals. Think of each experience as an investment
                            of your time and how you can build from those experiences. The most valuable thing I've learned
                            throughout is that one needs to ﬁnd good mentors. Your growth is directly proportional
                            to the kind of people you work with or who mentor you. Someone willing to spend time on you
                            is way more important than chasing top opportunities where someone might not have enough time on
                            their hands to take you through the initial work or understandings.

                            Best of luck! Feel free to reach out to me in case of questions, and try to pack in as much experience and explore as many domains as you can during your undergrad!

                                AICVS held another Kaggle competition from 13th February 2022 to 20th February 2022. In our quest for learning and doing more and more difficult things , we should always go back to the basics first. It was with this in mind that this dataset was chosen.
                        
                                Machine learning is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past data without programming . It’s difficult to fathom just how vast and diverse our natural world is. There are over 5,000 species of mammals, 10,000 species of birds, 30,000 species of fish – and astonishingly, over 400,000 different types of flowers.
                        
                                In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model to classify 5 types of flowers - ['sunflower', 'tulip', 'daisy', 'rose', 'dandelion'] on the basis of their given images.
                                <br>
                        
                        
                                The winners of the competition were:

                                AICVS held another Kaggle competition from 13th February 2022 to 20th February 2022. In our quest for learning and doing more and more difficult things , we should always go back to the basics first. It was with this in mind that this dataset was chosen.
                        
                                Machine learning is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past data without programming . It’s difficult to fathom just how vast and diverse our natural world is. There are over 5,000 species of mammals, 10,000 species of birds, 30,000 species of fish – and astonishingly, over 400,000 different types of flowers.
                        
                                In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model to classify 5 types of flowers - ['sunflower', 'tulip', 'daisy', 'rose', 'dandelion'] on the basis of their given images.
