                                    AICVS held another extremely exciting Kaggle competition centered on job salary
                                    prediction. The goal of this competition was to create a prediction model that
                                    can accurately forecast the salaries of employees in the data science domain
                                    using regression techniques or any other suitable algorithms. Participants were
                                    provided with a CSV data file containing relevant parameters such as job roles,
                                    qualifications, and experience, which they used to build their models. The
                                    competition took place between 10th November, 2022 and 17th November, 2022, and
                                    saw a total of 60 registrations. As a testament to the competitive nature of the
                                    event, only three winners emerged, showcasing their skills and expertise in the
                                    field of data science.

                                    AICVS held another Kaggle competition from 13th February 2022 to 20th February
                                    2022. In our quest for learning and doing more and more difficult things , we
                                    should always go back to the basics first. It was with this in mind that this
                                    dataset was chosen.

                                    Machine learning is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn
                                    from past data without programming . It’s difficult to fathom just how vast and
                                    diverse our natural world is. There are over 5,000 species of mammals, 10,000
                                    species of birds, 30,000 species of fish – and astonishingly, over 400,000
                                    different types of flowers.

                                    In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model to
                                    classify 5 types of flowers - ['sunflower', 'tulip', 'daisy', 'rose',
                                    'dandelion'] on the basis of their given images.

                                    Completion of each course prepares you for the next one and builds on what you
                                    learnt in the previous one. We will allocate 1 week for each course. Each course
                                    takes upto 3-4 hrs and so you can easily complete it at your own pace in the
                                    allocated time. At the end of the week a quiz will be conducted to test the
                                    understanding of the participants. This series will be followed by the
                                    conduction of Kaggle competition so that you all can apply what you have learnt

                                    AICVS held another beginner friendly Kaggle competition from 5th December 2021
                                    to 11th December 2021. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may
                                    cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
                                    to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe
                                    diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute
                                    Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes
                                    coronavirus disease COVID-19 - World Health Organization.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This dataset contains latest Covid-19 India state-wise data as on November 28,
                                    2021. It consists of 9 columns representing the attributes and 36 data entries.

                                    Your task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on this dataset and draft a
                                    report to summarize your findings. Provide as many meaningful inferences using
                                    graphs and charts as you can. You are allowed to use any data visualization
                                    library or tools.

                                    AICVS held another extremely beginner friendly Kaggle competition from 10th
                                    October 2021 to 17th October 2021 . In order to make their profit, insurance
                                    companies must collect a higher premium than the amount paid to the insured
                                    person. Due to this, insurance companies invest a lot of time, effort, and money
                                    in creating models that accurately predict health care costs.

                                    You are provided with the Data which consists of age, sex, BMI(body mass index),
                                    children, smoker and region feature, which are independent features and charge
                                    as a dependent feature. Your task is to predict individual medical costs billed
                                    by health insurance. To beginners we suggest approaching the problem statement
                                    using linear regression.

                                    AICVS held another extremely beginner friendly Kaggle competition on 29th
                                    November 2020 from 12 noon to 12 midnight. In our quest for learning and doing
                                    more and more difficult things , we should always go back to the basics first.
                                    It was with this in mind that this dataset was chosen.

                                    Machine learning is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn
                                    from past data without programming . It is important that credit card companies
                                    are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are
                                    not charged for items that they did not purchase.

                                    The dataset that we used was " Credit Card Fraud Detection". The dataset
                                    contained transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European
                                    cardholders.

                                    This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492
                                    frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the
                                    positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

                                    It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA
                                    transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the original
                                    features and more background information about the data was not provided.

                                    The winners of the competition were:

                                    The fact that one of the winners was a second year , when the competition was
                                    held, proved that even people who don't have a background in ML and have started
                                    recently , can participate in competitions and even win.
                                </p>

                                    Since this was our fifth time holding a Kaggle competition, the participants did
                                    not face a lot of issues. Thanks to the teams efforts , it was a smooth sailing
                                    for everyone. Please go through our website articles for more information on
                                    what AICVS does and the various events that we have hosted. Till the next

                                    Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women other than skin cancer.
                                    Increasing age is the most common risk factor for developing breast cancer, with
                                    66% of breast cancer patients being diagnosed after the age of 55. It starts
                                    when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form
                                    tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

                                    The key challenges against it’s detection is how to classify tumors into
                                    malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). AICVS organized this competition
                                    with some real world issues in mind. It was held on 8 November 2020 12 noon to
                                    12 midnight. The competitors Were asked to complete the analysis of classifying
                                    these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin
                                    (Diagnostic) Dataset.

                                    The data was split into two groups: training set (train.csv) and test set
                                    (test.csv) The training set was used to build the machine learning models. For
                                    the training set, we provided the outcome (also known as the “ground truth” or
                                    "target variable" which is "diagnosis" in our case) for each Id. The models of
                                    the participants were based on “features” like radius_mean, area_mean, etc. The
                                    detailed description of the features was mailed to the competitiors.

                                    The test set was used to see how well the participant's model performed on
                                    unseen data. For the test set, the ground truth for each Id was not provided. It
                                    was the participant's job to predict these outcomes. For each Id in the test
                                    set, the model that was trained was used to predict whether the tumor was Benign
                                    or Malignant.

                                    We had also included a sample_solution.csv file which contains a set of
                                    predictions that assume all females have Benign tumors as an example of what a
                                    submission file should have looked like.

                                    The winners of this competition were:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Akanksha Hatle , Score : 0.98076</li>

                                </ul>
                                The participants who made submissions were given a Completion Certificate and the
                                winners got a Certificate of Excellence.

                                In these trying times we at AICVS hope that we can offer some much needed escape
                                from reality and ensure that your journey towards Machine learning doesn't stop. We
                                hope to organize more competitions like this. Till the next competition, Stay Home
                                and Stay Safe!!!

                                    The AICVS club hosted a competition based on Deep learning and computer vision
                                    on the Kaggle interface on 4th October, 2020. The participants were supposed to
                                    submit their entries from 00.00 a.m. to 11.59 p.m., after solving the dataset
                                    remotely on their laptops.

                                    The competition was about predicting the prices of houses in Boston based on
                                    different parameters using Linear Regression. For this, we had to use the Boston
                                    Housing Dataset from Kaggle.

                                    During these trying times, AICVS has tried to ensure that we provide quality
                                    content and ample learning opportunities for everyone , no matter their skill
                                    level. To make sure that everyone was on the same page , tutorials for people
                                    new to Machine Learning and Kaggle , were provided.

                                    The winners of the competition were :

                                    When Vaishnavi was asked to give some tips for beginners, she said “Firstly, I
                                    would suggest them to learn Python as mostly the code demonstration is done in
                                    Python. If anyone is searching for online resources or courses, I would like to
                                    suggest them to take the Caltech Tele Course, in which ML has been explained
                                    really great, theoretical. And for a hands on experience, take the Andrew Ng’s
                                    course. Be curious and practice by yourself as much as you can.”

                                <p>
                                    We would like to thank the participants for showing so much vigor and enthusiasm
                                    for the Kaggle competitions hosted by us. We hope to bring you many more
                                    competitions like this.
                                </p>

                                Till then keep practicing :))

                                    AICVS held another Kaggle competition from 13th February 2022 to 20th February
                                    2022. In our quest for learning and doing more and more difficult things , we
                                    should always go back to the basics first. It was with this in mind that this
                                    dataset was chosen.

                                    Machine learning is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn
                                    from past data without programming . It’s difficult to fathom just how vast and
                                    diverse our natural world is. There are over 5,000 species of mammals, 10,000
                                    species of birds, 30,000 species of fish – and astonishingly, over 400,000
                                    different types of flowers.

                                    In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model to
                                    classify 5 types of flowers - ['sunflower', 'tulip', 'daisy', 'rose',
                                    'dandelion'] on the basis of their given images.

                                    AICVS held another Kaggle competition from 13th February 2022 to 20th February
                                    2022. In our quest for learning and doing more and more difficult things , we
                                    should always go back to the basics first. It was with this in mind that this
                                    dataset was chosen.

                                    Machine learning is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn
                                    from past data without programming . It’s difficult to fathom just how vast and
                                    diverse our natural world is. There are over 5,000 species of mammals, 10,000
                                    species of birds, 30,000 species of fish – and astonishingly, over 400,000
                                    different types of flowers.
